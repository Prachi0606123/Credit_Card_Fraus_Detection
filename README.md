Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Objective:

Developed a machine learning-based fraud detection system to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms on a real-world dataset.

Data Preprocessing and Exploration:

•	Preprocessed the Kaggle dataset provided by MLG-ULB, handling missing values, detecting and addressing outliers, and applying feature scaling to standardize the data.

•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset, aiding in feature selection.

Algorithm Implementation:

•	Utilized the Decision Tree algorithm to create a robust classification model for identifying fraudulent transactions based on key features.

•	Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify transactions based on similarity measures, contributing to a hybrid, ensemble-based approach for fraud detection.

Model Optimization:

•	Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance, improving accuracy and generalization.

•	Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective detection of fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

Performance and Insights:

•	Achieved accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 96% for fraud detection by leveraging a balanced dataset and optimizing algorithm parameters.

•	Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining Decision Tree and KNN algorithms in a hybrid model to enhance detection reliability.

Technologies Used:
Python, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine Learning Algorithms (Decision Tree, KNN)

Insights:

•	Improved model accuracy and reduced overfitting through careful hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

•	Identified key features impacting fraudulent transaction detection, enhancing model interpretability and performance.
